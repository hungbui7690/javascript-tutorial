/*
  Class vs. Custom type
  - Despite the similarities between a class and a custom type defined via a constructor function, there are some important differences.

  - First, class declarations are not hoisted like function declarations.
    > For example, if you place the following code above the Person class declaration section, you will get a ReferenceError.
        let john = new Person("John Doe");

  - Second, all the code inside a class automatically executes in the strict mode. And you cannot change this behavior.

  - Third, class methods are non-enumerable. If you use a constructor/prototype pattern, you have to use the Object.defineProperty() method to make a property non-enumerable.

  - Finally, calling the class constructor without the new operator will result in an error as shown in the following example.
        let john = Person("John Doe");
        <> Uncaught TypeError: Class constructor Person cannot be invoked without 'new'

  @@ Note that itâ€™s possible to call the constructor function without the new operator. In this case, the constructor function behaves like a regular function.

//////////////////////////////
// ES6 introduced a new syntax for declaring a class as shown in this example:
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }
  getName() {
    return this.name
  }
}
/*
  This Person class behaves like the Person type in the previous example. However, instead of using a constructor/prototype pattern, it uses the class keyword.
  
  In the Person class, the constructor() is where you can initialize the properties of an instance. JavaScript automatically calls the constructor() method when you instantiate an object of the class.
*/

//////////////////////////////
// The following creates a new Person object, which will automatically call the constructor() of the Person class:
let john = new Person('John Doe')

// The getName() is called a method of the Person class. Like a constructor function, you can call the methods of a class using the following syntax:
let name = john.getName()
console.log(name) // "John Doe"

// To verify the fact that classes are special functions, you can use the typeof operator of to check the type of the Person class.
console.log(typeof Person) // function

// The john object is also an instance of the Person and Object types:
console.log(john instanceof Person) // true
console.log(john instanceof Object) // true
